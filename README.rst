The Package varprox is designed for solving penalized separable non-linear least squares problems. It extends the standard variable projection method by adding regularization on the non-linear variable. More details can be found on the `documentation <https://Varprox.github.io/varprox/>`_.

Package features
================

- Methods for minimizing separable non-linear least squares problems with penalizations and box constraints on variables.

- Applications to the inference for stochastic processes. 


Installation from sources
=========================
