This directory contains the scripts used for the numerical study in the paper untitled "VARPROX: a primal-dual variable projection method for minimizing penalized separable non-linear least squares".

* expe_data.py creates a database composed of anisotropic fractional Brownian fields and their realization.
* expe_fit.py fits the simulated images to a model using varprox.
* expe_analyse.py analyzes the results and draws examples.

The database is stored in the directory data, while the results are in the directory results.
